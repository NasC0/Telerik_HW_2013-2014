	* In the ManufacturerFactory classes

Design pattern: Strategy
	* In the FactoryMaker class

Design pattern: Template Method
	* In the BaseCPU class and it's children

Design pattern: Abstract factory
	* In ComputerBulderEntryPoint.cs and the Manufacturer factory classes

Design pattern: Composite
	* 

Design pattern: Mediator
	* 

Found bottlenecks:
	* Fixed bottleneck in the Random number generation in BaseCPU class
	* 

Found bugs:
	* Fixed Null referrence exception in the CPU class (video card = null)
	* I couldn't find any other bugs, but the application works correctly, so i assume i fixed them while refactoring.
