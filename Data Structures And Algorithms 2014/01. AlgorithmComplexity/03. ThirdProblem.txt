* What is the expected running time of the following C# code? Explain why.
long CalcSum(int[,] matrix, int row)
{
    long sum = 0;
    for (int col = 0; col < matrix.GetLength(0); col++) 
        sum += matrix[row, col];
    if (row + 1 < matrix.GetLength(1)) 
        sum += CalcSum(matrix, row + 1);
    return sum;
}

Console.WriteLine(CalcSum(matrix, 0));

Assume the input matrix has size of n * m.

Explanation: Worst case scenario is algorithm complexity O(n ^ 2) since for each element (if the equality check goes through) we fall in another row ... n loop, which is effectively a O(n ^ 2) complexity.
