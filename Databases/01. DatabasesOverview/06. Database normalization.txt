A database schema is normalized when all it's fields and tables are organized to reduce redundancy.
A normalized databse has several advantages:

- Reduced data repetition - many tables store different kinds of information. When that information is required in another table, a relation is created between tables through the use of foreign keys.
- Easier and faster data manipulation.
- Makes the data model more informative to users.
- Simplified operations over the data in the tables.
