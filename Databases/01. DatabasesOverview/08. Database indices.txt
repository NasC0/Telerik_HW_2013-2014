Pros: 
- Speeds up searching in a large table exponentially.
- Adds another level of redundancy to the table (it is recommended that the data in the indexed column is mostly unique).

Cons:
- Slower data manipulation operation execution, since the indexed B-Tree needs to be rebalanced every time the data in it is changed.
- Increase the server space required by the database.
