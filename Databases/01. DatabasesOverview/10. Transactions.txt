Transactions are used when you need a set of queries to execute as a whole. If a single query in this set fails to execute, all the previous actions of the set are reversed. It is used to ensure that sensitive operations which require more than one query are executed properly, without reprecussions if the process stops midway.

The most prominent example is when money in a bank is moved from account to another - let's say you try to wire some money to another account. If a fatal error occurs inbetween the withdrawal and deposition of the money, the originating account's balance is lower as it should be, but the recipient doesn't recieve the money. Transactions are used in situations like these, to ensure that if a fatal error does occur, all the actions are reverted and the originating account (or recipient) doesn't lose money.
