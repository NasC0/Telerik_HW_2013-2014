What is the expected running time of the following C# code? Explain why.

long CalcCount(int[,] matrix)
{
    long count = 0;
    for (int row=0; row<matrix.GetLength(0); row++)
        if (matrix[row, 0] % 2 == 0)
            for (int col=0; col<matrix.GetLength(1); col++)
                if (matrix[row,col] > 0)
                    count++;
    return count;
}

Assume the input matrix has size of n * m.

Explanation: Worst-case scenario: O(n * m), since in the worst case none of the entries checked are equal to zero, hence we loop through all m elements n number of times.
