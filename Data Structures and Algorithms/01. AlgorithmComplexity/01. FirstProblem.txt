What is the expected running time of the following C# code? Explain why. Assume the array's size is n.
long Compute(int[] arr)
{
    long count = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<arr.Length; i++)
    {
        int start = 0, end = arr.Length-1;
        while (start < end)
            if (arr[start] < arr[end])
                { start++; count++; }
            else 
                end--;
    }
    return count;
}

Explanation: Worst Case scenario: O(n ^ 2) since for each element n, we have another loop from 0 to n - 1. Even if the end variable is decremented, the algorithm doesn't increase the start variable, which effectively means another O(n) loop over the elements.
